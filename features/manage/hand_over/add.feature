Feature: Add lines during hand over

  In order to hand things over and add lines to the contract
  As a lending manager
  I want to be able to have functionlities to add lines

  Background:
    Given I am Pius
     When I open a hand over

  @javascript @personas
  Scenario: Add an item to the hand over providing an inventory code
    When I add a borrowable item to the hand over by providing an inventory code
    Then the item is added to the hand over for the provided date range and the inventory code is already assigend
    When I add an unborrowable item to the hand over by providing an inventory code
    Then the item is added to the hand over for the provided date range and the inventory code is already assigend

  @javascript @personas
  Scenario: Add an option to the hand over providing an inventory code
    And I add an option to the hand over by providing an inventory code and a date range
    Then the option is added to the hand over

  @javascript @personas
  Scenario: Increase the quantity of an option of the hand over by adding an option providing an inventory code
    And I add an option to the hand over which is already existing in the selected date range by providing an inventory code
    Then the existing option quantity is increased

  @javascript @personas @browser
  Scenario: Add a template to the hand over picking an autocomplete element
    And I type the beginning of a template name to the add/assign input field
    Then I see a list of suggested template names
    When I select the template from the list
    Then each model of the template is added to the hand over for the provided date range

  @javascript @personas @browser
  Scenario: Add lines which changes other lines availability
    And I add so many lines that I break the maximal quantity of an model
    Then I see that all lines of that model have availability problems

  @javascript @personas @browser
  Scenario: Add an option to the hand over picking an autocomplete element
    And I type the beginning of an option name to the add/assign input field
    Then I see a list of suggested option names
    When I select the option from the list
    Then the option is added to the hand over

  @javascript @personas @browser
  Scenario: Add an model to the hand over picking an autocomplete element
    And I type the beginning of a model name to the add/assign input field
    Then I see a list of suggested model names
    When I select the model from the list
    Then the model is added to the hand over

  @javascript @personas @browser
  Scenario: hand over items even if not borrowable
    Given I open a hand over
    And there is a model or software which all items are set to "not borrowable"
    When I type the beginning of that model name to the add/assign input field
    Then I see a list of suggested model names
    And I see that model in the list of suggested model names as "not borrowable"
    When I select the model from the list
    Then the model is added to the hand over
